# Midnight Train

The station was empty, save for a lone figure standing under the flickering light. The clock struck twelve, and the ground began to rumble.

A train emerged from the fog, its headlights cutting through the darkness. It wasn't on the schedule. In fact, no trains were supposed to run at this hour.

The doors slid open with a hiss. The figure stepped inside without hesitation. I watched as the train pulled away, disappearing as quickly as it had arrived.

I never saw the figure again, but sometimes, on quiet nights, I can still hear the faint whistle of the midnight train.
