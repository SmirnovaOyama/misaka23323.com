I go to the same coffee shop every morning. I order the same drink, sit at the same table, and watch the same people come and go.

There's the businessman who always looks stressed, checking his watch every five minutes. The student with the messy hair and the pile of textbooks. The old couple who share a scone and read the newspaper together.

We don't know each other's names, but we're a part of each other's lives. We're the morning crowd, the regulars.

One day, the businessman didn't show up. Then the student stopped coming. The coffee shop felt empty without them.

But then, new faces appeared. A young woman with a sketchbook. A man with a guitar. Life went on, and the coffee shop chronicles continued.
