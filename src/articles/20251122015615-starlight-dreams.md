As a child, I used to lie on the grass and stare up at the stars. I imagined that each one was a world waiting to be discovered.

I dreamed of traveling through space, visiting distant planets, and meeting alien civilizations. I built rocket ships out of cardboard boxes and wore a colander as a helmet.

Years passed, and I grew up. The cardboard boxes were recycled, and the colander went back to the kitchen. But the dream never faded.

Now, as I look through the telescope in my backyard, I still feel that same sense of wonder. The stars are still there, waiting for me. And maybe, just maybe, one day I'll reach them.
