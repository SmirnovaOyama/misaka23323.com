There's a bookstore on the corner of 5th and Main that only appears when you're not looking for it. I stumbled upon it one Tuesday when I was trying to escape a sudden downpour.

The bell chimed as I pushed the door open. The smell of old paper and dust filled the air. Shelves lined the walls, reaching up to the ceiling, packed with books of all shapes and sizes.

An old man sat behind the counter, reading a book with a leather cover. He didn't look up as I approached.

"Looking for anything in particular?" he asked, his voice raspy.

"Just browsing," I said.

But I wasn't just browsing. I was looking for a story that hadn't been written yet. And I had a feeling I might find it here.
