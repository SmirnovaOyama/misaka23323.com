## Introduction
Welcome to **misaka23323.com** (“the site”).  
This website is a simple, static personal blog that may also include browser-based mini-games.  
We value your privacy, and this Privacy Policy explains what information we do **not** collect and what limited information may be collected automatically when you use the site.

---

## Information We Do Not Collect
Because this site is purely static and contains no account system, comments, forms, or user-submitted features:

- We **do not collect** personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or any identifying details.  
- We **do not store** user-generated content or messages.  
- We **do not run** analytics that track user identity.

## Information Automatically Collected
Like most websites, some minimal, non-identifying technical data may be collected automatically by your browser or hosting provider, such as:

- Basic server logs (e.g., IP address, browser type, access time)  
- Referrer information  
- Pages viewed  

These logs are used only for basic site operation, performance monitoring, and security. They are not linked to any specific personal identity.

## Cookies and Local Storage
Some mini-games or features may use:

- **Local storage** to save game progress or preferences  
- **Cookies** only if strictly necessary for functionality  

We do **not** use cookies or storage for tracking, advertising, or analytics.

## Third-Party Services
If the site uses third-party assets (e.g., embedded fonts, scripts, or content delivery networks), those services may collect their own technical data according to their respective privacy policies.

We do not share or sell any information to third parties.

---

## Children’s Privacy
This site does not knowingly collect personal information from children. As no personal data is collected from any user, the site is safe for general audiences.
