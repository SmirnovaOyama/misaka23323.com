I found the letter in a bundle of old mail I had meant to throw away. It was addressed to me, but there was no return address.

I tore open the envelope and pulled out a single sheet of paper. The handwriting was familiar, but I couldn't place it.

"Dear friend," it began. "If you're reading this, then I'm already gone."

My heart pounded as I read on. It was a confession, a story of regret and missed opportunities. But it was also a message of hope.

"Don't make the same mistakes I did," the letter concluded. "Live your life. Be happy."

I folded the letter and put it in my pocket. I didn't know who had sent it, but I knew I would cherish it forever.
