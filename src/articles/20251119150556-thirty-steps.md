*10 p.m.* The wind comes off the basketball courts, threads through the banyan trees, skims the lake, carrying a faint, humid sweetness. Most of the Dongguan campus lights are out now—only the guard booth and the blue-white lamps at the crossroads remain. I follow the little path downhill toward the abandoned house—once a rehabilitation teaching room. People say that at night you can hear a beat in there, like a clock, or like someone counting their steps.

The house is small, its paint flaking; a pair of rusty parallel bars lean by the door. Inside, a cracked mirror faces the wall. Along its edge, yellowed diagrams are taped up: ankle pumps, swing-through gait, sit-to-stand. In the corner lies a human skeleton model with one arm missing; the knuckles still hold the gummy residue of kinesio tape. The room is empty, yet it carries the after-feel of “someone just left”—the alcohol tang of antiseptic not fully dispersed, the thin medical smell still in the air.

I swing my flashlight down. On the floor tiles are fine, oval droplets that run from the door to the parallel bars—not raindrops, but little ovals, like sweat falling off shoe soles right after a walking set. I swallow and start to turn away when I hear a *tock—tock—tock* beating along the wall behind me, moving slowly closer. The beat is even, unhurried—like a metronome in rehab.

“Twenty-seven steps.” A gentle woman’s voice fills the room, slightly breathless. “Three more, and we’ll call it a day.”

In the space between the parallel bars, the air dents—just a little—as if an unseen body settles its weight, then shifts. The beat continues: *tock—tock—tock.* The voice is soft, but admits no refusal. “Twenty-eight, twenty-nine… thirty. Good.” Then all sound draws back at once, like a tide.

I retreat to the doorframe. In the darkness, a dull glow flickers from the canteen. That place has been shut for ages; the window grates are dusty, the bulletin board still shows an old “Today’s Specials” poster. Yet at that moment, a lamp seems to wake there, groggy and warm. I do not intend to go, but my feet carry me.

The main doors are locked; the side serving window is half ajar. I slide my hand in and push—the metal panel parts with a scraping “gaa.” Inside is black as a flooded basin, but light spills from behind the serving counter at the far end. It wavers, like water just about to boil. Along with the light comes a familiar smell—plain rice congee and pickled greens, the scent of home fare.

“Student.” The same gentle voice, now from behind the counter. “Would you check if they’ve eaten enough?”

I lift the flashlight. Behind the counter there is no one, just a line of ladles and skimmers swaying slowly. Two porcelain bowls sit on the counter; the congee in one still breathes a little steam. Its surface doesn’t ripple, yet it steadily lowers, as if an invisible spoon is scooping. The ticket machine gives a soft *ding* and spits out a short, yellowed strip: `Rehabilitation Supper`. A blurred red stamp bleeds across the end—someone’s hand must have shaken over the word “rehab.”

To my surprise, I am not afraid. Perhaps the smell is too much like the porridge we pool money for in the dorm at night; perhaps the voice has the work-rhythm of my grandmother when she was young. “More?” I say. The second it leaves me I feel foolish—asking whom? But the ticket machine prints again, the neat perforations like a key pressed by an orderly hand.

I carry one bowl back to the little house the way I came. The congee is hot enough to sting my fingers. As I step in, the beat returns: *tock—tock—tock.* The voice says, “Sit first. Sip, then stand.” I set the bowl on the small bench inside the parallel bars. The surface of the congee makes a tiny ring and then lowers by the width of a fingertip. Staring into the empty bars, I feel my nose prickle.

“Teacher?” I call softly. The voice pauses, as if looking me over—or hesitating. “Don’t be scared,” she says. “I’m not here to frighten anyone. It’s just… some kids won’t eat, and some won’t finish their steps. I used to run between these two places—persuade them here, then hurry there. Later… later my body wouldn’t allow it. I’ve worried over it ever since.”

“I can help,” I say. The moment I speak, I realize I’ve made a decision without thinking it through. The woman laughs—a small sound. “Then please,” she says, “count to thirty.”

I stand just outside the parallel bars, like on the edge of an invisible boundary. In one bowl the congee level slowly drops; in the other, warmth gathers in my palm. The metronome holds steady. I start: “One, two, three…” At seventeen, the beat stumbles, like an ankle giving way. The woman’s voice dips with it: “Don’t rush. Chin up. Think of the wind outside.” I obey, drawing in a lungful through the door crack—the damp breeze carries banyan and earth. The beat steadies again. Together, we count to thirty.

I jog back to the canteen for the second bowl. When I return, the first is empty, neat congee lines tracing the porcelain like the grid of a practice book. I set down the second. “Eat your fill, then sleep a while,” she says. For a moment, the room’s chill turns into the cool of a hospital corridor at four in the morning—cold, but not sharp.

“Teacher,” I ask, “what’s your name?”

She doesn’t answer at once. I think she won’t. After a while, the ticket machine *dings* again. I run to catch the slip. Two clean strokes: **Lin Lan**.

I tuck the strip behind the slot beneath my college badge. Back in the little house, the metronome stops. Those unseen feet seem to lie down. Her voice is very light. “Thank you. I never wanted to scare anyone. I just want them to eat, and to make it to thirty steps.”

“I’ll look in when I pass by at night,” I say. As the words leave me, a fine rain starts outside, tapping the iron of the parallel bars like a tight burst of applause.

The next day, a notice goes up on the campus board: the little house and the old canteen will be renovated into a new public activity room and a nutrition-teaching site. At noon I pass the canteen. A new lock gleams on the door; the windows are wiped clean. In the sunlight, I see a corner of a label inside the glass peel up—`Extra Meal Ticket`. The wind lifts it and lays it back down, like a hand waving from within.

That night, I bring two hot buns. The little house is still shut; the room is quiet. I leave the buns on the bench between the bars and step back. For a long time, nothing happens. Only the wind comes from the canteen, carrying fresh paint and the breath of steamers. I am about to leave when the gentle voice rises at my back, almost lost in the breeze: “Eat your fill, then go walk.”

I do not dare turn. I just nod, and head back along the path. The streetlights stretch my shadow long. At the seventeenth step I stop and look up into the tree. Then I go on, counting to thirty...
