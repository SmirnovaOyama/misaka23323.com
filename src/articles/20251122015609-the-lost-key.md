It was a rainy afternoon when I found the key. It didn't look like much, just a rusty piece of metal half-buried in the mud. But something about it called to me.

I picked it up, wiping the dirt off on my jeans. It was heavy, heavier than it looked. There were intricate carvings along the shaft, symbols I didn't recognize.

I spent the next few weeks trying to find the lock it opened. I tried every door in my house, every chest in the attic, even the old gate at the back of the garden. Nothing.

Then, one day, I found a small box hidden under the floorboards of my bedroom. It had a keyhole that looked like a perfect match.

With trembling hands, I inserted the key. It turned with a satisfying click.
