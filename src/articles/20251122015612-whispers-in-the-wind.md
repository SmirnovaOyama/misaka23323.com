# Whispers in the Wind

They say if you listen closely enough, the wind will tell you secrets. I never believed it until I moved to the countryside.

The house was old, creaky, and full of drafts. At night, the wind would howl through the cracks in the windows. At first, it was just noise. But then, I started to hear words.

"Help..." "Below..." "Found..."

I tried to ignore it, telling myself it was just my imagination. But the voices grew louder, more urgent.

One night, I followed the sound to the cellar. The wind was whistling through a small hole in the wall. I put my ear against it and heard a voice, clear as day.

"Let me out."
