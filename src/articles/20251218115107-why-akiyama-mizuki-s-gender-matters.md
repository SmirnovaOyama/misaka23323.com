## 1. Introduction: Why Mizuki’s Gender Matters

Akiyama Mizuki from *Project SEKAI: Colorful Stage!* (pjsk) is, on paper, a fairly straightforward character concept: a high-school student, an animator and video editor for Nightcord at 25:00 (25-ji, Nightcord de.), and a lover of cute fashion. In practice, Mizuki has become one of the most discussed and contested characters in contemporary mobile game fandom because of one particular design choice: their gender is officially listed as “Unknown” (「？」).([Saimoe][1])

The combination of:

* explicitly feminine visual design,
* masculine-coded Japanese first-person pronoun use,
* an English localization that defaults to *they/them* pronouns, and
* narrative arcs explicitly about bullying, outing, and gender nonconformity

has produced intense debate over whether Mizuki should be read as a transgender girl, nonbinary, “just” gender-nonconforming, or intentionally indeterminate.([Pocket Tactics][2])

In what follows, I will treat Mizuki as a literary object: a constructed figure whose “gender” exists both as in-universe identity and as a set of signals negotiated among writers, artists, localizers, and audiences. I will first outline what is canonically known about Mizuki, then examine how the text and its localizations handle gender, and finally discuss the major interpretive positions—transfeminine, nonbinary, and deliberately ambiguous—before offering a synthetic reading of Mizuki’s gender as structured ambiguity with a distinctly transfeminine center of gravity.

Throughout, I will use *they/them* for Mizuki when speaking at the level of “official” canon, reflecting the English localization’s neutral choice and the game’s own policy of non-specification, while noting when particular readings or communities prefer *she/her* or other pronouns.([Project SEKAI Wiki][3])

## 2. Canonical Overview of Akiyama Mizuki

### 2.1 Basic profile and role in the narrative

Mizuki is introduced as a second-year student at Kamiyama High School and the animator/video editor for Nightcord at 25:00, working under the alias “Amia.”([Project SEKAI Wiki][3]) They discover Yoisaki Kanade’s music, create a music video for one of her songs, and are then invited into the circle by Kanade herself.([Project SEKAI Wiki][3])

The Sekaipedia and Project Sekai wikis summarize them in terms that are strikingly consistent: a talented animator and costume-maker, highly invested in “cute” and “girly” fashion, with an older sister Yuuki—herself a fashion designer—who serves as a major point of inspiration.([Project SEKAI Wiki][3])

This background is important. Mizuki’s love of fashion and cuteness is not a superficial quirk; it is central to both their creative practice and their sense of self. It also becomes the axis around which bullying and social exclusion at school are organized, as their classmates interpret this gender expression as deviant.

### 2.2 The “Unknown” gender field

One of the few hard facts we have is that Mizuki is the only *Project SEKAI* character whose official gender field is set to “?” or “Unknown.”([Saimoe][1]) Other characters receive standard entries like “male” or “female”; Mizuki alone is marked by a question mark. This is not a translation artifact: Japanese wiki and database entries reproduce the same symbol, and secondary sources note this as a deliberate design choice.([Saimoe][1])

Thus, *canonically*:

* Mizuki is a teenager at Kamiyama High.
* They are an animator and video editor.
* They are obsessed with cute, feminine fashion.
* Their gender field is “Unknown”/「？」.

Everything beyond that is not *labeled* in the usual metadata sense, even though the story presents strong cues.

## 3. How the Text Handles Gender: Language, Visuals, and Story

### 3.1 Linguistic choices in Japanese

In Japanese, Mizuki predominantly uses **boku** (ボク) as their first-person pronoun.([Tumblr][4]) *Boku* is strongly associated with boys and young men, especially in school settings, though its use by girls is not unheard of in manga/anime when a character is coded as tomboyish, gender-nonconforming, or otherwise atypical. The choice of *boku* therefore suggests a disalignment between external feminine styling and a pronoun conventionally coded as masculine.

Importantly, Mizuki briefly uses **atashi** in the song “Kitty.”([Tumblr][4]) *Atashi* is a casual, often youthful feminine variant of *watashi*, strongly associated with girls and women in conversational Japanese. That Mizuki employs *atashi* situationally has been read by fans as:

* an index of comfort with a feminine self in certain spaces,
* a performative experiment with femininity, or
* a deliberate signal by the writers that Mizuki’s interior gender position is more complex than a straightforward “boy in a skirt” cliché.

Crucially, Japanese does not require third-person pronouns in the way English does. Many sentences that would be *“She went to class”* or *“They felt anxious”* in English simply omit the subject, or use Mizuki’s name. The original text, then, can avoid specifying she/he/they in many places where English must choose.

### 3.2 English localization and pronoun policy

The English localization of *Project SEKAI* adopts *they/them* as Mizuki’s third-person pronouns and generally avoids gendered language, instead repeating Mizuki’s name where possible.([Project SEKAI Wiki][3]) Fans, wiki editors, and commentators have consistently noted that this should be understood as a **strategy for preserving ambiguity**, not as an explicit declaration that Mizuki identifies as nonbinary.([Urban Dictionary][5])

Tool-style analyses of the localization emphasize that:

* third-person pronouns in English must be chosen even where Japanese would omit them;
* *they/them* offers a way to avoid prematurely “solving” Mizuki’s gender while remaining grammatically viable;
* the localization team is constrained by the original decision to keep the gender field “Unknown.”([Toolify][6])

This is a textbook example of how linguistic structure shapes character interpretation: many anglophone players encounter *they/them* as identity pronouns first and only secondarily as generic singular, so the localization’s neutral intent is often reinterpreted as a nonbinary confirmation.

### 3.3 Visual design and feminization

Visually, Mizuki reads overwhelmingly as feminine: long pink hair in pigtails, soft facial features, fashion silhouettes that emphasize skirts, ruffles, ribbons, and cute accessories, and card art that places them in pastel, highly “girly” environments such as fashion studios or candy-like spaces.([Sekaipedia][7])

These aesthetics are not incidental. In their backstory, Mizuki is bullied precisely for dressing in cute, feminine clothing, with classmates framing this as a transgression against expected gender presentation.([Fanlore][8]) The art direction therefore supports a reading of Mizuki as someone whose external gender expression is insistently feminine, even where social norms resist or punish it.

### 3.4 Narrative arcs of otherness, secrecy, and outing

Canon text repeatedly emphasizes that Mizuki has been treated as an outcast, especially in middle school, where they often escape to the rooftop to avoid others—encounters that lead to their friendship with Kamishiro Rui, another socially marginal figure.([Sekaipedia][9])

More pointedly, the later “Mizu5” story arc (often associated with the event *Whither This Path of Thorns*) foregrounds:

* Mizuki’s fear that a “secret” about them will be discovered;
* classmates gossiping and using language that contrasts Ena, described as a “real girl,” with Mizuki, implying that Mizuki’s femininity is viewed as illegitimate;
* scenes of being outed and targeted for their gender expression.([Pocket Tactics][2])

Journalistic discussion of this arc in games media explicitly frames it as a nuanced portrayal of trans or gender-nonconforming experience, highlighting the emotional impact of being outed and the complex mix of shame, fear, and desire for recognition that Mizuki navigates.([Pocket Tactics][2])

Taken together, the narrative pattern is not random “mystery for fun.” It is a sustained engagement with what it means to have a gendered self that cannot safely appear in certain social contexts.

## 4. Three Major Readings of Mizuki’s Gender

Because the text is deliberate in its ambiguity, multiple readings coexist. In practice, three major interpretive positions dominate fandom discussion.

### 4.1 Mizuki as transgender girl / transfeminine

A very substantial portion of the fandom reads Mizuki as a **transgender girl** or **transfeminine person**. This reading is particularly prominent in LGBTQ+ fan communities, informal wikis devoted to queer representation, and Urban Dictionary entries that describe Mizuki as “implied to be transfem” or straightforwardly as “the representative of all transfems.”([LGBT Characters Wikia][10])

The evidential basis for the transfeminine reading typically includes:

1. **The school bullying context.**
   Mizuki is treated not merely as “weird,” but specifically as someone whose feminine self-presentation is illegitimate in the eyes of classmates, who contrast them with a “real girl.”([Tumblr][11]) This maps closely onto real-world transphobic tropes rather than generic “eccentric fashion” ridicule.

2. **The narrative of secrecy and fear of being found out.**
   Mizuki’s “secret” is consistently framed as something about themself that, if revealed, would destroy their fragile sense of belonging. Nightcord becomes the first community where they feel they can “be themselves” without fear.([Sekaipedia][12]) For many trans players, this parallels the experience of being stealth or closeted.

3. **The combination of *boku* and *atashi*.**
   Rather than indicating mere androgyny, the oscillation can be read as reflecting a transfeminine trajectory: someone assigned male, socialized into masculine pronouns, experimenting with feminine language in spaces of safety.

4. **External discourse framing.**
   Games journalism and queer character databases sometimes straightforwardly describe Mizuki as a transgender character or as clearly trans-coded, noting that the story explores the trauma of being outed in a way unusual for mainstream gacha games.([LGBT Characters Wikia][10])

Within this frame, the official “Unknown” is not treated as “Mizuki has no gender,” but as “the text refuses to pin down what the character knows about themself, even though all the signals point toward transfemininity.” Some Tumblr and wiki editors go as far as to assert that Mizuki is *canonically* a trans girl as of a particular story update, arguing that the classroom scenes and explicit verbal contrasts make this conclusion unavoidable, even if the metadata never switches from “?”.([Tumblr][11])

### 4.2 Mizuki as nonbinary or otherwise beyond binary categories

A second major reading understands Mizuki as **nonbinary**, **genderqueer**, or **otherwise outside the man/woman binary**.

This interpretation leans heavily on:

* the explicit “Unknown” gender field;
* the English localization’s consistent use of *they/them*;
* the fact that Mizuki is coded as gender-nonconforming in ways not wholly reducible to a trans girl narrative, such as their comfort inhabiting a range of pronoun and style choices.([Urban Dictionary][5])

Nonbinary-focused fandom spaces have historically included Mizuki in lists of nonbinary characters, sometimes with caveats about the ambiguity.([Tumblr][13]) From this vantage point:

* Mizuki’s love of cute, feminine clothing is not evidence that they “must” be a girl;
* the discomfort expressed in the story may concern being forcibly assigned male or female, rather than being affirmed in a nonbinary identity;
* the oscillation in self-presentation is read as a nonbinary person navigating binary expectations.

This reading is reinforced by a broader cultural shift wherein *they/them* pronouns are strongly associated with nonbinary identities, leading some players to treat the localization’s choice as an implicit statement rather than a purely technical compromise.([Urban Dictionary][5])

### 4.3 Mizuki as permanently ambiguous / “question mark” character

A third position holds that Mizuki is fundamentally designed as a **deliberately unsolved question**, a “Schrödinger’s gender” figure whose purpose is to generate discourse and allow varied player identification without ever being pinned down.

Supporters of this view emphasize:

* the persistent “?” in official materials even as late story arcs tackle topics that could easily justify a concrete label;([Saimoe][1])
* statements in fan meta that interpret the ambiguity as a marketing tactic, intended to maximize engagement and “theories”;([Tumblr][14])
* wiki policies that avoid claiming specific pronouns, using Mizuki’s name instead whenever possible to respect the ambiguity.([Project SEKAI Wiki][15])

On this interpretation, Mizuki is less a puzzle with a hidden answer and more a deliberately unstable figure whose function is to evoke the *feeling* of being gender-nonconforming without ever being locked into a category. Players are then free—within fandom norms—to adopt she/her, they/them, or mixed pronoun sets according to their own identification. Many discussion threads explicitly encourage this “choose your own interpretation” approach while discouraging harassment over pronoun preferences.([Project SEKAI Wiki][16])

## 5. Language, Localization, and the Production of Gender

To understand why Mizuki’s gender debate is so heated, we must pause on the structural problem of moving from Japanese to English.

### 5.1 Japanese: pronouns as stylistic, not obligatory

Japanese often omits third-person pronouns entirely; subject and object are inferred from context. When pronouns are used, they carry strong stylistic and social connotations, but they are not the constant grammatical backbone of every sentence in the way English third-person pronouns are.([Tumblr][4])

Mizuki’s core linguistic markers—*boku* and occasional *atashi*—therefore function as:

* signals of social positioning (masculine socialization, feminine aspiration, rebellion against norms),
* tools for character voice,
* and hints to attentive players about complexity.

They are not, by themselves, a “gender label” in the way a profile field would be.

### 5.2 English: the tyranny of pronouns

English requires explicit pronouns in many places where Japanese can be silent. When the localization tries to translate a line that in Japanese simply has “Mizuki went” or “Went and said,” it must choose *he*, *she*, *they*, or rephrase altogether.

The localization team’s decision to:

* avoid he/she where possible,
* use Mizuki’s name frequently, and
* default to *they/them* when unavoidable

is thus less a direct statement of identity and more an attempt to simulate the original’s deliberate opacity in a language that does not support pronominal vagueness by default.([Toolify][6])

However, because *they/them* is strongly associated with nonbinary identity in anglophone contexts, this technical choice acquires ideological weight in the eyes of many players. Fan essays and guide-style articles warn against over-interpreting this, noting that *“they/them pronouns in the official English translation does not necessarily confirm Mizuki’s non-binary identity.”*([Urban Dictionary][5])

### 5.3 Metadata vs. diegesis

Another key distinction is between **metadata** (the profile gender field) and **diegetic narrative** (what characters say and experience in the story). For Mizuki:

* metadata: “Unknown” gender;
* diegesis: a story deeply concerned with gender norms, policing of femininity, and the trauma of being outed.([Pocket Tactics][2])

The ambiguity arises because the metadata refuses to “summarize” the diegesis into a label. This allows for multiple interpretive communities to exist in parallel, each privileging different aspects of the text.

---

## 6. Representation, Marketing, and Ethics

### 6.1 Ambiguity as opportunity and as avoidance

From one perspective, Mizuki’s design is a remarkably sophisticated engagement with gender variance in a mainstream rhythm game: the story depicts bullying, misrecognition, outing, and the eventual formation of a supportive found family, all centered on a character whose relationship to gender norms is central to their arc.([Pocket Tactics][2])

From another perspective, the refusal to supply a concrete label—“trans girl,” “nonbinary,” “genderqueer,” and so on—can be read as a form of **plausible deniability**. Tumblr commentators argue that keeping Mizuki’s gender “unknown” is at least partly a marketing tactic: it invites debate and fan labor while allowing the company to avoid controversy in markets where explicit trans representation might be contentious.([Tumblr][14])

Both views can be true simultaneously:

* For many players, especially those who are trans or questioning, Mizuki is a meaningful vehicle for identification and catharsis, regardless of official labels.
* For critics of “queerbaiting” and “queer-coding,” the pattern of heavily implying queerness without naming it feels familiar and unsatisfying.

### 6.2 Fandom as co-author

Because the text deliberately leaves gaps, fandom effectively co-authors Mizuki’s gender. Wikis, fan essays, and social media posts organize and stabilize particular readings:

* LGBTQ+ character databases list Mizuki as transgender.([LGBT Characters Wikia][10])
* Other sites and meta essays warn that Mizuki’s exact identity is not canonically pinned down and encourage respectful multiplicity of pronoun use.([Urban Dictionary][5])

In this sense, “Mizuki’s gender” is not a single object but a bundle of overlapping interpretive practices. For some communities, it is important and politically significant to treat Mizuki as a trans girl; for others, to claim them as nonbinary representation; for still others, to insist on preserving the question mark as a space of radical indeterminacy.

## 7. Toward a Synthetic Reading: What, Exactly, Is Mizuki’s Gender?

If we attempt, as literary critics, to synthesize the available evidence, several points emerge.

1. **The text is undeniably about gender.**
   The themes of bullying, “real girl” vs. Mizuki, secrecy, and outing are not generic; they are rooted in conflict over how Mizuki is perceived in relation to gender norms.([Pocket Tactics][2])

2. **The direction of the conflict points toward transfemininity.**
   The core social script—someone assigned and treated as male being punished for feminine self-presentation and accused of not being a “real girl”—maps closely onto transfeminine experience, more than onto agender or purely nonbinary scripts.([Pocket Tactics][2])

3. **The official metadata resists naming this.**
   The “Unknown” marker keeps the character open. It does not negate the transfeminine coding, but it prevents it from being canonized.

4. **Localization adds a nonbinary flavor without overturning the above.**
   *They/them* pronouns in English push readers toward nonbinary interpretations, but careful commentary emphasizes that this is a technical and political compromise rather than an explicit label.([Urban Dictionary][5])

5. **Players’ identifications are real, even when not canon.**
   For a trans girl player who sees her experience mirrored in Mizuki, it matters less whether the metadata ever flips from “?” to “female” and more that the narrative gives form to her feelings. The same is true for nonbinary players who recognize the refusal to fit binary labels.

Given these points, one reasonable synthetic position is:

> Mizuki is best understood as a **transfeminine, gender-nonconforming character whose in-universe gender identity is intentionally left unlabeled**, allowing multiple equally legitimate fan identifications.

That is, the *vector* of the character’s story is toward femininity—toward being recognized as some kind of girl—while the *label* remains suspended. Nightcord at 25:00, as a space where Mizuki can wear the clothes they love and be accepted, functions as an implicit affirmation of this movement, even if no NPC ever says the words “you are a girl” or “you are nonbinary.”

## 8. Conclusion: Living with the Question Mark

Akiyama Mizuki is not the first fictional character to have an ambiguous or contested gender, but they are unusual in the degree to which that ambiguity is **structural** rather than accidental. The writers, artists, and localizers of *Project SEKAI* have collaborated—intentionally or not—in constructing a character whose official gender is “Unknown,” yet whose story is densely packed with motifs familiar from transgender and gender-nonconforming lives: policing of presentation, fear of being found out, the longing for a space where one’s self can appear safely, and the complicated work of naming or not naming that self.([Pocket Tactics][2])

From an analytical standpoint, it is productive to resist the urge to collapse Mizuki into a single definitive label. Instead, one can say:

* **Canonically**, their gender is left unspecified, marked only as “?”.
* **Textually**, their experiences align strongly with transfeminine narratives of bullying and outing.
* **Linguistically**, Japanese pronominal play and English *they/them* localization produce layers of meaning that pull in both transfeminine and nonbinary directions.
* **Culturally**, fandom’s ongoing negotiation of Mizuki’s gender demonstrates how audiences participate in the construction of identity for fictional characters, especially when those characters speak to real marginalized experiences.

In that sense, Mizuki’s “unknown” gender is not a void but a dense, charged space—a question mark filled with transfeminine resonances, nonbinary possibilities, and the lived realities of players who see themselves, in one way or another, in the kid from Kamiyama High who loves cute clothes and is just trying to exist.
